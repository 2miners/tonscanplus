# TonscanPlus

There are a lot of different explorers on The Open Network, but when it comes to convenience and ease of use, many people choose tonscan.org. Thanks to its native-clear design, any user can find any address in just a few clicks.

The Daily TON team consider it important to bring TON users something that still was not added by the original team of developers — the address book. In fact, the explorer has it, but there is no real opportunity for 99.9% of users to add some specific TON address or to save one for themselves to use.

That is why we decided to create this Google Chrome extension.

# Features

- Add your custom names to TON addresses locally

- Send pull requests to this repository to expand the community-driven database
